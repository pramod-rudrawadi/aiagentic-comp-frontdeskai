# CLAUDE.md — FrontDesk AI

## Project Overview

FrontDesk AI is a self-evolving agentic AI employee support desk built with FastAPI, LangGraph, and Ollama Cloud/Groq/OpenRouter LLMs. It routes employee chat requests through a supervisor agent to domain-specific workers (HR, Tech, Finance, Facilities, Analytics, Account, Skill Admin), with RAG-powered policy retrieval, tool-calling, QA checks, and escalation handling.

**Primary LLM:** provider-selectable via `LLM_PROVIDER`. Default is Ollama Cloud (`api.ollama.com`) — `gemma4:cloud` via `ChatOllama` — with Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) as the automatic fallback. On the Spark cluster it is `litellm`: an OpenAI-compatible gateway whose base URL and per-participant key are injected by the platform, so the app needs no vendor account. `_build_llm` in `agents.py` knows four providers — `ollama`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `litellm`.

**What makes it agentic:** The system teaches itself new capabilities at runtime — admins describe a skill in plain English, and the system researches APIs, writes Python code, validates it, installs it to disk, configures it (API keys encrypted in DB), and executes it via domain workers. Everything persists across restarts with zero rebuild. Skills, config, LLM provider, and SMTP settings are all managed through conversation.

## Quick Start

### One command (any environment)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # set OLLAMA_API_KEY and/or GROQ_API_KEY
bash scripts/quickstart.sh    # cluster if missing → app → MCP → health check → seed verification
```

`quickstart.sh` is the supported participant path and is idempotent. It pulls `OLLAMA_API_KEY`,
`GROQ_API_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_*` from the environment into `.env` (Codespaces secrets), fails early with
instructions when no LLM key is set, and prints the demo logins when the app answers `/health`.
`SKIP_MCP=true` skips the PostgreSQL/MCP stack.

In a Codespace, `.devcontainer/setup.sh` runs `quickstart.sh` automatically when a key is available from a
Codespaces secret — clone, launch, done, with demo data already seeded.

### Local (without Kubernetes)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python app/app.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

Requires `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (primary) and optionally `GROQ_API_KEY` (fallback) in `.env`.

### GitHub Codespace / kind cluster

Codespace: devcontainer auto-provisions the kind cluster via `.devcontainer/setup.sh`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # set OLLAMA_API_KEY + GROQ_API_KEY
bash scripts/deploy.sh        # build + load into kind + deploy + rollout restart
# Open http://localhost:8000  (NodePort 30800 — no port-forward needed)
```

### cloud-labs / localhost (kind)

```bash
bash scripts/create-kind-cluster.sh   # one-time: creates kind cluster 'frontdeskai' + /shared/.sqlite
cp .env.example .env                  # set OLLAMA_API_KEY + GROQ_API_KEY
bash scripts/deploy.sh                # same command as Codespace — auto-detects kind context
# Open http://localhost:8000  (NodePort 30800 — no port-forward needed)
```

**Host prerequisite — passwordless sudo** (required by `create-kind-cluster.sh`):
```bash
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER
```

**Host prerequisite — inotify limits** (required for Promtail — add to `/etc/sysctl.conf` for persistence):
```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=512
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

### Observability stack (optional)

```bash
bash scripts/install-observability.sh
# Open http://localhost:3000  (agenticai / agentgrow.io) — NodePort 30300, no port-forward needed
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/app.py` | FastAPI routes: login, chat, KB management, analytics API, admin gates, `/chat/feedback` (👍/👎 → few-shot memory). The chat reply returns the audit trail to every user (it was already rendered on `/chat` reload); the raw `tool_calls` list stays admin-only |
| `app/agents.py` | LangGraph StateGraph: supervisor, 8 domain workers, QA, manager, fallback. Dynamic LLM factory (`get_llm()`) supports Ollama Cloud, Groq, and OpenRouter providers |
| `app/auth.py` | Password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256, 600k iter), `users` table, `current_user_email` ContextVar |
| `app/tools.py` | LangChain `@tool` functions for each domain + schema/seed data. HR tools include `get_leave_balance_from_hr_system` (MCP client) as the primary leave *read*; applying goes to local `apply_leave`, which auto-approves ≤3 days and otherwise files a `pending` row whose number it returns. The manager side is `list_pending_leave_requests()` (no args — the team comes from `employees.manager_id`) and `approve_leave_request(request_id, status)`, which admits only the requester's own manager, never the requester, re-checks the balance at decision time and deducts it then; the employee reads it back with `list_my_leave_requests()`. Domain tools take **no** identity argument — `_get_current_employee_id()` reads the `current_user_email` ContextVar. `approve_expense_claim(claim_id, status)` additionally checks *authority* via `_expense_approval_denial()`: the claimant's manager, or a finance department member whose designation contains lead/manager/director/head/vp/chief, and never the claimant themselves |
| `app/skills.py` | Dynamic skill registry: load/install/list/configure skills, web research tools, `skill_config()` helper, runtime tool injection |
| `app/rag.py` | ChromaDB indexing of `app/data/policies/*.md` into the `unigps_policies` collection, retrieval with category filtering (ONNX embeddings, no torch). Persists to `$CHROMA_DIR` (default `/shared/chromadb`) |
| `app/fewshot.py` | Few-shot memory — successful Q&A pairs in the `fewshot_examples` Chroma collection, retrieved per-category by semantic similarity and injected into domain worker prompts. Written by a 👍 via `/chat/feedback` when `_qualifies_for_fewshot` passes (confidence ≥ 7, not escalated, not fallback, category not general/blank); 👎 removes it from SQLite and Chroma. Memory is per-category and shared across users |
| `app/observability.py` | OpenTelemetry metrics, Prometheus exporter, JSON logging, Langfuse integration. One process-wide Langfuse `CallbackHandler` (langfuse 2.x builds a client + consumer threads per handler, so per-request handlers leaked threads); per-request identity travels as `langfuse_metadata()` in the RunnableConfig; `flush_langfuse()` runs on shutdown; `JsonFormatter` emits every `extra=` field |
| `mcp/mcp-postgre/mcp_leave_server.py` | FastMCP server (streamable-http, port 8001) — `get_leave_balance`, `get_leave_usage`, and `approve_leave` (records the request and deducts days atomically) backed by PostgreSQL. Unknown employee_ids are auto-provisioned with the default entitlement. The server itself trusts whatever `employee_id` it is given; the client-side tools in `app/tools.py` are what bind the call to the caller |
| `mcp/postgre/configmap-init.yaml` | PostgreSQL init SQL — employees/leave_balances/leave_requests in the default `public` schema + 4 seed employees with leave data |
| `scripts/deploy-mcp.sh` | Deploy MCP stack (PostgreSQL + MCP server) into `postgres` namespace, includes smoke test |

## Agent Categories

`hr`, `tech`, `finance`, `facilities`, `analytics`, `account`, `skill_admin`, `general`

- **hr/tech/finance/facilities**: Route through RAG retrieval → few-shot retrieval, then domain worker with tools
- **analytics**: Bypasses retrieval, goes directly to analytics worker with analytics tools
- **account**: Bypasses retrieval, goes directly to account worker with `change_my_password` tool
- **skill_admin**: Bypasses retrieval, admin-only (non-admins routed to general). Tools: `search_web`, `fetch_webpage`, `install_skill`, `list_skills`, `set_skill_config`, `get_skill_config`, `get_llm_config`, `change_llm_model`, `configure_fallback_llm`, `configure_smtp`, `get_smtp_config`, `send_email`. Workers also get dynamically-injected skill tools matching their category. Admins can change the LLM model, provider (ollama/groq/openrouter), API key, fallback LLM, SMTP email settings, and per-skill configuration at runtime via chat.
- **general**: Static response, no tools

Before category routing, the supervisor's confidence gates the graph: a score below 5 routes to the `clarify` node instead of a worker, which asks a follow-up question and goes straight to `finalize`.

## Databases & Storage — Zero-Rebuild Persistence

All runtime state is persisted to survive restarts without redeployment. The three SQLite DBs live in `$SQLITE_DIR` (default `/shared/.sqlite`); the vector store and skills sit alongside it under `/shared`:

- `$SQLITE_DIR/history.db` — chat messages + `users` table (per-user password hashes)
- `$SQLITE_DIR/frontdesk_tools.db` — employees, leave, tickets, expenses, rooms, payslips, system_config (LLM + SMTP + skill config settings, secrets Fernet-encrypted)
- `$SQLITE_DIR/checkpoints.db` — LangGraph checkpointer
- `$CHROMA_DIR` (default `/shared/chromadb`) — ChromaDB: `unigps_policies` (RAG) + `fewshot_examples` collections
- `/shared/.frontdeskai/skills/` — dynamic skill Python files (loaded at startup + on install)

The agentic loop: skill code → filesystem, skill config → DB, LLM/SMTP config → DB. On restart, skills auto-load from disk, config is read from DB — no manual intervention.

## Authentication Flow

1. Login checks `get_user_password(email)` first (per-user hash)
2. If no stored password, verifies against `AUTH_PASSWORD` env var, then saves hash
3. JWT token set as httponly+samesite cookie (24h expiry)
4. `current_user_email` ContextVar set before graph invocation for secure tool identity

```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | `ollama`. Set to `litellm` to use an OpenAI-compatible gateway. Read by **both** `agents.py` and `tools.py` — `tools.py` seeds `system_config` in SQLite and `load_llm_config()` reads it back, and that seed wins over the module default, so the two must always read the same env |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | provider-specific default |
| `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` / `LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL` | No | `groq` / `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. An **empty** `LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL` disables the fallback (`get_fallback_llm()` returns `None`) — which is what you want where no second vendor is reachable |
| `LITELLM_BASE_URL` / `LITELLM_API_KEY` | With `LLM_PROVIDER=litellm` | falls back to `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_BASE` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | Yes when `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` | — sign up at https://ollama.com |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Recommended as fallback | — sign up at https://console.groq.com |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | No (alternative provider) | — |
| `HOME` | **Do not set** | `/opt/appcache`, set by the image. ChromaDB resolves its embedding-model cache from `Path.home()` and the model is baked in at that path. Overriding `HOME` sends it looking for a model it must then download — see the Spark section |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Production | Auto-generated in dev (also used to derive SMTP password encryption key — if rotated, admin must re-run `configure_smtp`) |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | No | `brainupgrade` |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | No | `admin@unigps.in` |
| `SQLITE_DIR` | No | `/shared/.sqlite` |
| `CHROMA_DIR` | No | `/shared/chromadb` |
| `MCP_LEAVE_URL` | No | `http://mcp-leave.postgres.svc.cluster.local:8001/mcp` (set in `deployment.yaml`) |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | No | `frontdeskai` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | No | `http://tempo.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317`. **Set it to the empty string to skip the OTLP exporter entirely** — `BatchSpanProcessor` swallows export failures, so a wrong endpoint drops every span while the app looks healthy. Tempo runs in `monitoring` on the Spark cluster since 2026-09-11 |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` |
| `SEED_DEMO_DATA` | No | `false` in code — but `true` in both `deployment.yaml` and `.env.example`, so every documented path starts with 10 employees, leave balances, tickets, expenses, rooms and payslips. The seed is idempotent (`INSERT OR IGNORE`), so it fills gaps on restart without overwriting runtime changes |
| `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | No (LLM tracing) | — all three Langfuse vars must be set, else tracing is disabled |
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` | No (LLM tracing) | — |
| `LANGFUSE_HOST` | No (LLM tracing) | — region-specific: `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` or `https://cloud.langfuse.com` (EU); traces are only visible in the UI of the matching region |

**Langfuse tracing** — the keys reach the pod through the `frontdeskai-secret` K8s secret, which is (re)built by `scripts/deploy.sh` from `.env`. Editing `.env` alone changes nothing in the cluster; run `bash scripts/deploy.sh` (or `bash scripts/update-secret.sh`) afterwards. Verify from the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/frontdeskai | grep -i langfuse
# "Langfuse enabled"  … keys present at startup
# "Langfuse handler ready" … with "auth_check": true after the first chat
```

**LLM defaults (overridable at runtime via admin chat):**
- Primary: `ollama` / `gemma4:cloud` (Ollama Cloud — `https://api.ollama.com`)
- Fallback: `groq` / `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (auto-used on primary failure)

Note: All runtime configuration is managed through chat (stored in `system_config` table, persists across restarts with zero rebuild): LLM model/provider/API key, fallback LLM, SMTP email settings, and per-skill configuration (API keys, base URLs, etc.). SMTP password and secret skill config values are encrypted with Fernet (derived from `SECRET_KEY`).

**Updating API keys — two options (no image rebuild required):**
1. **Zero-downtime via admin chat** — login as admin and say `update ollama api key to <key>`; the `skill_admin` worker saves it to DB and hot-reloads immediately.
2. **Script** — `bash scripts/update-secret.sh` reads all keys from `.env`, patches the K8s secret, and restarts the pod.

## Agentic Loop (Self-Teaching)

The full agentic cycle for adding a new capability, entirely via chat:
1. **Research** — `search_web` + `fetch_webpage` to discover APIs/approaches
2. **Write code** — LLM generates Python with `SKILL_META`, `config_keys`, `@tool` functions, `skill_config()` reads
3. **Validate** — AST parse, check for `SKILL_META` dict and `@tool` decorators
4. **Persist** — Save `.py` file to `/shared/.frontdeskai/skills/` (survives restart)
5. **Load** — Import module, register tools into `_loaded_skills` registry
6. **Configure** — Admin sets API keys via `set_skill_config` → encrypted in `system_config` DB
7. **Execute** — Domain workers get skill tools injected at invocation time, `skill_config()` reads config from DB

## MCP Leave Service

Employee leave queries are handled by a remote MCP server in the `postgres` namespace backed by PostgreSQL. Reads go through the HR worker (`get_leave_balance_from_hr_system`); writes go through `approve_leave_via_mcp`, which both the HR worker and the escalation **manager** node can call to approve leave directly in PostgreSQL. Neither tool takes an `employee_id`: both derive it from the session via `_mcp_employee_id()`, so one employee cannot read or approve another's leave, and both call sites (HR worker, manager node) only ever act on the employee who made the request.

```

                                         public schema · seed data
```

**Deploy:** `bash scripts/deploy-mcp.sh` (PostgreSQL + MCP server + smoke test)

**MCP_LEAVE_URL:** `http://mcp-leave.postgres.svc.cluster.local:8001/mcp` — set as env var in `scripts/manifests/deployment.yaml`

**Transport:** `streamable-http` (stateless) — no session handshake, single POST per tool call.

**Key settings applied in `mcp_leave_server.py`:**
- `mcp.settings.stateless_http = True` — no session ID required per call
- `TransportSecuritySettings(enable_dns_rebinding_protection=False)` — allows K8s pod-to-pod DNS

## Scripts & Manifests

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scripts/quickstart.sh` | **Participant entry point** — validates/populates `.env`, creates the cluster if missing, deploys app + MCP, waits for `/health`, verifies seeded row counts, prints demo logins. Idempotent; `SKIP_MCP=true` to skip MCP |
| `scripts/create-kind-cluster.sh` | One-time localhost/cloud-labs setup — creates kind cluster `frontdeskai` with NodePort mappings + `/shared/.sqlite`; equivalent of `.devcontainer/setup.sh` for non-Codespace hosts |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | One-command deploy — build + load/push + apply manifests + rollout restart, auto-detects kind vs production; preserves existing `SECRET_KEY` to avoid breaking encrypted DB values. Requires **at least one** of `OLLAMA_API_KEY` / `GROQ_API_KEY` (neither is individually mandatory) |
| `scripts/deploy-spark.sh` | **Spark cluster / participant namespace deploy.** Takes no arguments — `APP_NAMESPACE` and `APP_HOST` are already exported in a sandbox shell. Creates the ConfigMap, Service, Deployment, PVC, Ingress and `frontdeskai-secret`, preserving `SECRET_KEY` across redeploys (it is the Fernet key for encrypted skill config). `IMAGE=` overrides the image |
| `scripts/manifests/spark/` | The Spark manifest set — **separate from the kind set on purpose**, because the participant namespace forbids NodePorts and caps memory |
| `scripts/eval/hr_worker_eval.py` | Prompt-regression eval: does the HR worker call its tools, and does it still refuse for other people? Runs the real worker against the real model. See `scripts/eval/README.md` |
| `scripts/deploy-mcp.sh` | Deploy MCP Leave Service — PostgreSQL + MCP server into `postgres` namespace + smoke test |
| `scripts/update-secret.sh` | Update K8s secret from `.env` without rebuilding image (preserves SECRET_KEY, includes OLLAMA_API_KEY + GROQ_API_KEY + Langfuse) |
| `scripts/install-observability.sh` | Install Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Tempo via Helm into `monitoring` namespace |
| `scripts/update-observability.sh` | Update one component without a full reinstall — `grafana`, `dashboard`, `prometheus`, `loki`, `promtail`, `tempo`, or no arg for everything |
| `scripts/generate-test-traffic.sh` | Generate load to populate observability dashboards |
| `skills/oci_compute.py` | OCI compute self-service skill (git-tracked source; `kubectl cp` it to `/shared/.frontdeskai/skills/` to install) |
| `scripts/manifests/deployment.yaml` | App deployment (image: `frontdeskai:latest`, imagePullPolicy: Never for kind) + `MCP_LEAVE_URL` env |
| `scripts/manifests/service.yaml` | NodePort service — http(80→30800), metrics(9090→30900) |
| `scripts/manifests/secret.yaml` | Secret template — `GROQ_API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, `AUTH_PASSWORD`, `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, optional Langfuse keys |
| `scripts/manifests/servicemonitor.yaml` | ServiceMonitor for Prometheus Operator |
| `scripts/observability/tempo.yaml` | Tempo Helm values — OTLP gRPC (4317) + HTTP (4318) receivers |
| `scripts/observability/loki.yaml` | Loki Helm values — SingleBinary, filesystem storage |
| `scripts/observability/promtail.yaml` | Promtail Helm values — JSON log parsing, trace_id label extraction |
| `scripts/observability/kube-prometheus-stack.yaml` | Grafana + Prometheus Helm values — datasources with full 3-way correlation |

## Deployment — Spark cluster, one participant namespace each (2026-09-11)

**This is the workshop path.** The kind path below is unchanged and still works; the two use
different manifest sets because a participant namespace is not a laptop.

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-spark.sh        # in a JupyterLab terminal — no arguments needed
```

`APP_NAMESPACE` (`agenticaiu<N>`) and `APP_HOST` (`agenticai<COHORT>u<N>-app.brainupgrade.in`) are
already exported in a sandbox shell, so the script needs nothing from the participant. It creates
the ConfigMap, Service, Deployment, PVC and **Ingress** — the Ingress must live in the participant
namespace, because an Ingress backend cannot cross namespaces.

**The image is built by GitHub Actions**, not locally: Actions tab → *Build and push Docker image*
→ Run workflow. It publishes `brainupgrade/frontdeskai` tagged with the full commit SHA, the short
SHA and `latest`, for **linux/amd64 and linux/arm64**.

### Five constraints of that environment, all measured — do not design around guesses

| | |
|---|---|
| **The nodes are arm64** | The cluster is a DGX Spark. An amd64-only image fails to pull with `no match for platform in manifest` and the pod sits in `ImagePullBackOff`. The workflow builds both arches; the arm64 leg is QEMU-emulated and takes ~12 min against ~2 for amd64 alone |
| **No internet egress** | `participant-egress` allows DNS, the `llm-serving` namespace, ingress-nginx and Langfuse:3000 — **nothing else**. This is *not* the `agenticai` sandbox namespace, which has `allow-egress-internet`. Anything fetched at startup must be baked into the image |
| **1Gi of memory limits for the whole namespace** | One pod at a 1Gi limit consumes all of it, so the Deployment uses `strategy: Recreate`. A RollingUpdate surges a second pod, which is quota-denied, and the rollout hangs with no useful message. A `kubectl run` debug pod is refused for the same reason — use `kubectl exec` into the app container, which ships Python |
| **Zero NodePorts** | `services.nodeports: 0`. ClusterIP + Ingress only |
| **The host is behind Cloudflare** | Two separate traps. It answers the default Python user agent with `403` / `error code: 1010`, so anything scripted against the public hostname needs a `User-Agent` header. And it gives up at **~100s with a 524** — a three-turn agent request exceeds that whenever the gateway is slow, and the 524 reads as a broken app while the pod is still working. Script against the pod (`kubectl exec … python3`), not the hostname |

### Traces go to Tempo in the `monitoring` namespace

`deploy-spark.sh` points `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at
`tempo.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317` and sets
**`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=frontdeskai-<namespace>`** — one Tempo serves the whole cohort, so the
service name has to carry the namespace or nobody can find their own traces. Read them in
Grafana: *Explore → Tempo → service.name*.

What a request produces, measured on u31: a `chat.send` root span with `user.email`,
`chat.history_turns` and `chat.category`, and a child span per agent step —
`llm.supervisor`, `llm.hr_react_iter_0..2`, `llm.hr_worker_final` — each carrying
`llm.tokens`. That is the view Langfuse does not give: Langfuse shows generations, this shows
where the wall-clock went across the whole graph.

⚠️ **A missing NetworkPolicy is invisible from inside the app.** The participant namespace is
default-deny egress; without a rule for `monitoring:4317` the exporter fails and
`BatchSpanProcessor` swallows it, so the app is healthy, the config looks right, and no span
ever lands. The rules live in `mtvlab/agenticai/tempo/`.

### The LLM comes from the platform, not from a vendor key

`LLM_PROVIDER=litellm` points `_build_llm` at an OpenAI-compatible gateway
(`http://litellm-gateway.llm-serving.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1`). The credential is **not copied**:
`deployment.yaml` mounts the platform's existing `agenticaiu<N>-llm` Secret with `envFrom`, so each
participant uses their own key with its own daily cap, and nothing needs a Groq or Ollama signup.
The fallback is disabled (empty `LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL`) because no second vendor is reachable.

⚠️ **The embedding model is baked into the image.** `Containerfile` pre-fetches ChromaDB's
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` into `/opt/appcache` and pins `ENV HOME` there. Without it the app crash-loops on
startup with `httpx.ConnectError` while every manifest is valid and every probe configured — the
download is refused by the network policy. **Never set `HOME` in the ConfigMap.**

### ⚠️ Conversation history anchors the workers — the HR tool-calling bug (2026-09-11)

The HR worker answered *"I cannot access records for other employees, such as Rajesh Kumar"* while
Rajesh Kumar was the logged-in caller, and called no tool. Both balance tools take **no arguments**,
so nothing was missing from the request; it was refusing outright.

It was not the model and not the wiring — both were checked first, and the same build answered
correctly on a clean thread. `format_history()` renders prior turns as `Support: …`, so **one
refusal in the transcript becomes an example the model follows**, and every later turn repeats it.

Measured with `scripts/eval/hr_worker_eval.py` (real worker, real model, four requests × clean and
poisoned history): **10/16 before, 16/16 after**. All four failures were under poisoned history. The
fix is wording — the HR prompt now says the employee named in the request *is* the caller and that
refusing applies only to a **different** person, and the identity line says so at the point of use
rather than leaving `Employee: <name>` to read as a third party. The "someone else's balance" case
still refuses in both arms.

**If you change a worker prompt, run that eval.** A prompt regression is invisible to `pytest`, and
this one shipped looking like a broken integration.

## Deployment — kind cluster (Codespace / cloud-labs / local)

**Cluster name:** always `frontdeskai`. Both setup paths converge on this name so `deploy.sh` works unchanged.

**Codespace** — devcontainer (`.devcontainer/`) provisions automatically:
- Base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.13-bookworm` — Python minor kept in sync with `Containerfile` (`python:3.13-slim`); Bookworm required (Bullseye has an expired Yarn GPG key that breaks the Docker-in-Docker install)
- Features: `docker-in-docker:2`, `kubectl-helm-minikube:1`
- `postCreateCommand`: `.devcontainer/setup.sh` — seeds `.env`, copies `OLLAMA_API_KEY` / `GROQ_API_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_*` from Codespaces secrets into it, delegates to `scripts/create-kind-cluster.sh` (cluster + `/shared/.sqlite`), then runs `scripts/quickstart.sh` **if a key is present** so the codespace comes up with a deployed, seeded app. With no key it prints the two remaining steps instead. App deps are deliberately **not** pip-installed here; they live in the image built from `Containerfile`, so the app runs only in the kind cluster.
- Participant-facing setup lives in `participant-instructions.md`; the guided demo tour lives in `use-case-scenarios.md`.

**cloud-labs / localhost** — run once manually:
```bash
bash scripts/create-kind-cluster.sh   # creates cluster + /shared/.sqlite, uses $USER for chown
```

**`scripts/deploy.sh`** auto-detects environment via `kubectl config current-context`:
- **kind** (context contains `kind`): `imagePullPolicy=Never`, `kind load docker-image --name frontdeskai`
- **production**: `imagePullPolicy=Always`, pushes to `${NAMESPACE}-registry.brainupgrade.in`

**Known host issues (cloud-labs):**
- `sudo` prompts: add user to `/etc/sudoers.d/$USER` with `NOPASSWD:ALL`
- Promtail `CrashLoopBackOff` (`too many open files`): bump inotify limits — `fs.inotify.max_user_instances=512`, `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288`; add to `/etc/sysctl.conf` for persistence

## Observability Stack

Full 3-way correlation: Prometheus metrics ↔ Loki logs ↔ Tempo traces, all linked via `trace_id`.

- **Traces**: OTLP gRPC → Tempo (port 4317) via `BatchSpanProcessor`
- **Metrics**: `/metrics` endpoint → Prometheus scrape (pod annotations required)
- **Logs**: structured JSON → stdout → Promtail → Loki (trace_id extracted as label)
- **Grafana**: datasources configured with derived fields (Loki→Tempo), exemplars (Prometheus→Tempo), tracesToLogs (Tempo→Loki)

Pod annotations required for Prometheus scraping (already in `deployment.yaml`):
```yaml
prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
prometheus.io/port: "8000"
prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
```

## Conventions

- Tools use `@tool` decorator from `langchain_core.tools`
- Domain tools are registered in `DOMAIN_TOOLS` dict in `tools.py`
- Workers are created via `make_domain_worker()` factory in `agents.py`
- New agent categories require updates to: `Classification.category` Literal, supervisor prompt, `WORKER_CONFIGS`, worker creation, `_WORKER_FNS`, `build_graph()`, `_VALID_CATEGORIES` in `app.py`, and fallback templates
- Dynamic skills are Python files in `SKILLS_DIR` with `SKILL_META` dict and `@tool` functions; they are auto-loaded at startup and can be installed at runtime by admins via chat
- Skill tools are injected into domain workers at invocation time based on the skill's `categories` list — zero overhead when no skills target a category
- Skills declare needed config via `config_keys` in `SKILL_META` and read values at runtime via `skill_config(skill_name, key)` from `skills.py`
- Skill config is stored in `system_config` with `skill.{name}.{key}` namespacing; secrets use `_enc` suffix and Fernet encryption
- Admin routes use `_require_admin()` helper, gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS`
- User input in prompts is wrapped in `[USER_REQUEST_START]`/`[USER_REQUEST_END]` delimiters
- **No tool accepts caller identity as an argument** (`employee_id`, `approver_id`, `booked_by`) — it always comes from the `current_user_email` ContextVar, including the MCP tools, which map it to the remote roster key via `_mcp_employee_id()` and refuse the call when the session has no identity. Worker prompts must not instruct the model to pass one
- Worker and manager prompts inject the current date (`Today is …`) so relative dates like "tomorrow" resolve correctly — the model has no clock of its own
- All SQL uses parameterized queries; column names are never constructed from user input
- `app/app.py` uses `__file__`-relative paths for `StaticFiles` and `Jinja2Templates` (required when running from repo root as `python app/app.py`)
